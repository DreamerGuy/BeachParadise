      <h3>Bay of Bahia</h3>
        <p>Nestled on the northern end of the Isle of Caludge, this beach is cited
          as the most popular <br> getaway for vacationers during peak summer months.
          Popular activities include scuba diving,<br> snorkeling, and bird watching.

      <h3>Selange Beach</h3>
        <p>Selange Beach is known for its temperate sand.
          Made up of ground coral due to thousands of years of <br>tectonic activity,
          the sand is always cool to the touch, despite the heat.
          The western portion includes <br>fantastic flora and fauna and many pre-Columbian ruins.

      <h3>Hunt Lagoon</h3>
        <p>Known primarily for it's hidden location on Kamar Island
          (which includes swimming through an <br>underground cave),
          Hunt Lagoon offers a peaceful respite from the tourist-laden locations found<br> throughout Kamar.
          If possible, make a visit at night â€“
          it's bioluminescent lagoon is like viewing<br> fireworks in the water!

      <h3>Moat Lagoon</h3>
        <p>Last, but certainly not least, is Moat Lagoon. This is one of the most
          difficult beach locations to <br>access.
          The lagoon is located inside of a prehistoric cenote, or underground aquifer.
          Accessing it <br>involves crossing the moat surrounding the lagoon (hence the name)
          with locals by kayak. Once<br> there,
          marvel at the phenomenal (and endangered) quetzal bird and its golden feathers.
